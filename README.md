# Lettuce Frontend SPA - Aurelia

This is a work in progress front end for the [Lettuce Server](https://github.com/bblazely/LettuceServer)

It is a port of a more complete [AngularJS 1.x version](https://www.github.com/bblazely/LettuceClient-AngularJS1).

Mainly working initially with pre-release Aurelia, attempting to get form validation, backend API calls and I18n working.
